Readme file for running the simulations.
Parameters for running the simulation in matlab.
Mandatory:

-'DataDirectory'-> output file path
-'FieldRange'-> correlation range of the generated field

Optional:

-'Horizon'-> length of edge for all plannign algorithms [default value is 20 meters]
-'AllowedDirections'-> Number of allowed directions from current position [default is 8]
-'Function'-> Underlying model assumed by mutual information controller[default value is 'spherical']
-'Algorithm'-> Type of controller used by the algorithm [default value is 'mutualInfo']
-'Strategy'-> Type of strategy used by the controller [default is 'sample']
-'Size'-> Size of the generated field [default is 300 meters]
-'Estimation'-> Determines whether the estimation procedure is on or off. If it is off there are two more mandatory parameters 'sill' and 'range' which are the known parameters of the field [default is 1 (estimation on)]
-'Sill'-> (*mandatory when 'Estimation' is off, discarded otherwise*) Underlying value of sill from the known model parameter
-'Range'-> (*mandatory when 'Estimation' is off, discarded otherwise*) Underlying value of range from the known model parameter

Possible values for the different parameters

-'FieldRange'-> any positive integer
-'Horizon'-> any positive integer (by increasing the value of horizon the computational cost increases)
- 'AllowedDirections'-> any positive integer [recommended values are between 4 and 16, more or less doesn't make a lot of sense for the purposes of the simulation]
-'Function'-> 'spherical' 'linear' 'quadratic' 'cubic'
-'Algorithm'-> 'mutualInfo', 'kriging'
-'Strategy'-> 'sample' 'greedy' 'ACO'
-'Size'-> any positive integer number
-'Estimation'-> 0 (off) or 1 (on)
-'Sill'-> any positive integer corresponding to the sill value of the field
-'Range'-> any positive integer corresponding to the ran ge of the field


Examples:

qrs.run('DataDirectory','./data/result','RandomSeed',2345233, 'FieldRange',100, 'Algorithm','mutualInfo', 'Strategy','sample', 'FieldModel','spherical')

RUNNING ON CLUSTER

Running many simulation on clusters can be done by mean of a bash script. In this directory there is one script provided with an example of simulation. Upload the root directory to the master node of the cluster, change permissions to the script (chmod a+x ./namefile) and execute it to start the simulation.
